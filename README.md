<!-- Hi, I'm Mark 👋
I'm a JavaScript engineer and lead developer working at Widen. While I'm not afraid of CSS, my true passion lies in JavaScript engineering and developer experience (DX). I love finding ways to simplify or improve development workflow to save time and make it more fun to work on applications. Wait, did I forget to mention how much I love TypeScript? -->


🔭 Recent projects

<!-- mskelton.dev. I'm finally working on putting together my own personal website. Better late than never!
Lariat. My company has adopted Playwright for end-to-end testing, and Lariat is an open source library I developed for them to reduce boilerplate when creating page objects.
Yarn outdated plugin. I've been using this plugin for quite a while now, but recently updated it to support Yarn 3 with some neat features including lockfile aware outdated dependency checking. -->

🌱 I’m currently learning

<!-- Tensorflow. I'm starting to learn about machine learning with Tensorflow for a small side project I'm working on.
Forex. I've begun exploring the world of foreign exchange, MetaTrader 4/5, expert advisors, and more.
Ergonomics, starting with my purchase of the Moonlander keyboard from ZSA. Super excited to continue to learn more about ergonomics and maintaining a healthy body while doing the things I love to do. -->

I dislike design and yet I maintain color themes for 2 IDEs and 2 websites. 🤷 -->
